Emotion Spa (Single Page Application)

This is a simple, single-file web application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It serves as a demo of "Single Page Application" (SPA) principles, where content is dynamically updated without reloading the entire page.

The application displays a selection of emotions as glowing buttons. When a user clicks on an emotion, the main navigation is hidden, and a content card appears showing a description and an emoji related to that emotion.
